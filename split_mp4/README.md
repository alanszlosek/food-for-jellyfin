Some day you may find yourself having purchased a DVD for a show your kid likes. The DVD creators may have decided to put more than 1 episode into a single DVD track, against all comprehension.

This script allows you to specify input files, and where in time to split the file into separate mp4 files.

Tech used:

* Python3
* Yaml
* ffmpeg

Be sure to pip install pyyaml before running.

Happy trails!
