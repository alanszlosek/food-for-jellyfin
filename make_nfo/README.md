Sometimes you need to override the title, description, or episode number for you TV shows. Perhaps the TMDb isn't quite reporting the correct description or episode number for your video files.

This script crawls a folder, extracts title, season number, and episode number from filenames and generates a corresponding nfo file for each video so you can customize.

Use case: Nova episode files.
